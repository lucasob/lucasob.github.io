Welcome to the world's most ✨overkill✨ static website ever!

## Building

* `npm start` will spin up a local react server
* `npm test` will run the component tests

## Deploying

* This uses Github Pages
* Once you're happy with what you've got, `npm deploy -- -m 'A message here'`
    * This will push a commit with the specified message on the gh-pages branch

### Resources

* This app uses the [Grommet](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-starter-new-app) React UI Library.
  * There is an accompanying [Storybook](https://storybook.grommet.io) for convenience.
  * Grommet also comes with [Icons](https://icons.grommet.io/)
